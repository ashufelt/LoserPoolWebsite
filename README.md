# Loser Pick'em Website

Right now implemented with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL DB, and HTMX for dynamic/interactive stuff.

I'd like to redo this entire thing using Go as the routing/server, SQL backend DB, and still HTMX focused at front-end.
Still need to learn some more on Docker and switch hosting for this to happen.
